## Perl dependencies
 List::MoreUtils (https://metacpan.org/pod/List::MoreUtils)

## Sample run
The associated dependencies of APP must be isntalled prior to attempt running the program. The details of these have been provided in [Installation.md](https://github.com/sohamsg90/APP-Alieness-by-Phyletic-Pattern/blob/main/docs/Installation.md). 

## Input
APP requires either a multiFASTA protein sequence file and the taxonomic IDs of the associated genome as the primary input files. 

The taxonomic IDs can be obtained by using the script `extract_taxIDs.sh`. An input file with the genome accession number (NCBI) is to be provided.
